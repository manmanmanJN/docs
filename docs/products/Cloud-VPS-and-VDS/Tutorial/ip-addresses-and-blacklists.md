# IP Addresses and Blacklists


## Is your VPS listed on UCEPROTECT L3?
The UCEPROTECTL3 Blacklist has a primary goal of forcing administrators or Internet Service Providers to educate their users about email abuse and take preventative measures to stop it from happening.

Contabo duly tests each and every IP address, which is freshly assigned to a server, against all common blacklists. Every IP address that is caught by this test is moved to quarantine prior to a reassignment. This makes sure every customer gets only clean and truly usable IP addresses that can be used for every purpose without any restrictions.

*Some time ago*, UCEPROTECT changed their listing policy and this has in turn caused high majority of the IP addresses from our network to be listed in their so-called "Level 3" blacklist. This is an AS wide blacklist and since we offer a variety of services, it is hard for us to avoid a listing on UCEPROTECT Level 3. The listing on UCEPROTECT Level 3 should not negatively impact your ability to send e-mails. Big mail providers (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) are not using the UCEPROTECT filters at all and e-mails to those providers are therefore not affected by this listing.

We also investigated the consequences of a Level 3 blacklisting at UCEPROTECT ourselves:

- Big mail providers (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) are not using the UCEPROTECT filters at all and e-mails to those providers are therefore not affected by this listing.
- Even smaller mail servers using the UCEPROTECT filters will most likely not include the Level 3 rules since UCEPROTECT themselves consider the Level 3 filter as too strict.

At Contabo - Spamming mails, Webpages that are associated with any type of Spamming and the similar types of content are expressly prohibited.

Our tutorial shows the basic settings for a mail server that should be set on any server
without an exception.  
Please note that delistings and changes of DNS and PTR records can take up to 24 hours.

For Windows - we have prepared a [tutorial](https://contabo.com/blog/install-e-mail-server-windows/) which is ready for you via the link and guides you through the set-up of your own e-mailing solution. We generally do not offer support / assistance regarding e-mailing services.


You may also save some time with [cPanel or Plesk](https://contabo.com/blog/how-to-save-time-with-control-panels/)

## Additional IP Addresses

As the Internet grows and due the difficulty & cost of obtaining new IPv4 subnets continously increase, we have decided to limit the maximum number of IP addresses per service to ensure the availability for all of our customers. We appreciate your understanding.

VPS: Up to +1 additional IPv4  
VDS: Up to +15 additional IPv4  
DS: Up to +25 additional IPv4

Via the 'Your services' and clicking on "Manage" button next to the VPS / VDS and choosing "Order Add-On".
